# ale-estimation

As a part of my thesis project, one of the goals was to provide the partner company with a model to estimate ALE
values for a companyâ€™s network. The code created and used for such estimations is provided here.

centrality_calculations.ipynb is a Python notebook file needed to obtain centrality metrics for a given network.

ale_estimation.ipynb is a notebook file which uses the previously obtained centrality scores in order to estimate asset ALE values.
